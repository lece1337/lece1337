## About Me
My name is lece, and i'm just a kid who likes to mess around and code every once in a while, or contribute to projects/repositories here on Github. Any repositores I post are just for fun, and usually for my purpose of learning. I like to make useless stuff too, so you probably won't find anything interesting here.
